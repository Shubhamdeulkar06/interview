## Q1 Tell me about a time when you faced criticism at work

Let's say that I was responsible for leading a project that involved developing a new software application for a client. After presenting the initial design to the client, I received some criticism about the user interface and some of the features that they felt were missing.

At first, I felt defensive and frustrated, but I realized that the client's feedback was actually an opportunity to improve the application and make it more user-friendly. I took the criticism to heart and worked with my team to make some changes to the design based on the client's feedback.

I also set up a meeting with the client to go over the changes we had made and to get their input on the new design. By taking the criticism seriously and being open to feedback, we were able to create a much better product that met the client's needs and exceeded their expectations. In the end, the project was a success and the client was very satisfied with the final result.

## Q24. Tell me a time when you solved a difficult problem.

One example of when I solved a difficult problem was when I was working on a project as a UI/UX designer, and we had a tight deadline to meet. One of the major issues we encountered was the design layout. The design layout that we had created wasn't working well with the overall theme of the project, and we had to make sure that the design was consistent with the rest of the project.

To solve this issue, I started by going back to the project requirements and analyzing the design brief. I also conducted research and gathered feedback from my team members and stakeholders. After brainstorming several solutions, I created several design options that were in line with the project's requirements and presented them to the team.

Together, we analyzed the options and made some tweaks and modifications to the design until we found the perfect layout that met the requirements and was consistent with the project's theme. The final design was delivered on time and was very well received by the stakeholders.

Through this experience, I learned that effective problem-solving requires a combination of creativity, research, and collaboration with team members and stakeholders.
